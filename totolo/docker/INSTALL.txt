themeontology.org
=================

This is a Dockerized set-up to run the themeontology website.

The folders m4/nginx/sphinx are not currently used. 
They represent components that, for cost reasons, were integrate into
a single monolith called tan-ru.

To build and run tan-ru locally, install docker and do e.g.:

> cd tstp/totolo/docker
> set DOCKER_REGISTRY=public.ecr.aws/m8o2v6v7
> docker compose -f docker-compose.tr.yaml -f docker-compose.tr.override.yaml up --build -d --remove-orphans

The following services should become available:

    https://127.0.0.1/
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The first runs on port 443.
